# Reinforcement Learning Game Agent (Pokemon Emerald)

**CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This project explores reinforcement learning in a **partially observable environment** using an emulator-based game as a testbed. The focus is on **environment design, state representation, and reward shaping**, rather than game completion.

## Project Goals
- Design a custom reinforcement learning environment
- Experiment with visual-based state representations
- Implement and evaluate reward shaping strategies
- Study agent learning behavior under partial observability

## Current State
- Core project structure established
- Initial environment scaffolding in progress
- Experimentation with state extraction and reward signals ongoing

## Technologies & Concepts
- Python
- Reinforcement Learning
- Emulator-based environments
- Partial observability
- Reward shaping
- Experimental evaluation

## Notes
- Game assets and ROM files are **not included** in this repository.
- This project is for **educational and research purposes** only.
- Implementation details and results will be expanded as development
