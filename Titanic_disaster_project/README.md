# Titanic Disaster Project

## Overview
This project is part of the Kaggle Titanic Competition, where the objective is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other factors.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- `train.csv` - Training dataset with passenger information and survival labels.
- `test.csv` - Testing dataset where survival needs to be predicted.
- `gender_submission.csv` - A sample submission file for reference.

## Files in this Repository
- **Titanic_Disaster_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Titanic Picture.jpg**: An image related to the Titanic disaster.
- **submission.csv**: Final model predictions for submission to Kaggle.
- **.gitignore**: Standard `.gitignore` file for version control.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed missing values and distributions.
   - Visualized relationships between features and survival.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Processed categorical variables.
   - Handled missing data.
   - Created new meaningful features.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Evaluated models using accuracy and cross-validation.
4. **Prediction & Submission**:
   - Selected the best-performing model.
   - Generated predictions for the test dataset.
   - Submitted results to Kaggle.

## Dependencies
To run this project, install the following Python packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yathamrrahul/Portfolio-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Titanic_disaster_project
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Disaster_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Results & Findings
- Key factors affecting survival include **gender, passenger class, and age**.
- Feature engineering and model tuning improved the prediction accuracy.
- Final model performance achieved **competitive accuracy** on Kaggle.

## Future Improvements
- Explore deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with ensemble methods for better generalization.
